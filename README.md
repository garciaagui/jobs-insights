## Description

**29th project** of the [Trybe][trybe-site-url] Web Development course.

Job Insights is an application developed in [Python][python-url] aimed at analyzing real job data. Its implementation was incorporated into a web application developed with [Flask][flask-url], allowing the user to make queries and use different filters for more accurate results.

The data was extracted from the [Glassdoor][glassdor-site-url] website and obtained through [Kaggle][kaggle-site-url].

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The entire Flask web application was developed and provided by Trybe. Of all the routes, I implemented only `/job/<index>`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The functions implemented by me are in `src/insights`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è I wrote tests for the functions implemented by Trybe. These tests can be found in the `brazilian`, `counter`, and `sorting` subdirectories of `tests`.

## Technologies

The project was developed in [Python][python-url]. The implementations were incorporated into a web application developed using the [Flask][flask-url] framework and [Jinja][jinja-url] templates. The tests were written using [Pytest][pytest-url], and code quality was ensured using the [Flake8][flake8-url] linter.
